				<h4>Quick Career Biography</h4>
				<h6>
					After receiving my Bachelor's of Business Administration from Gonzaga,
					I attended the PDX Code Guild Bootcamp to make myself into a double
					threat. Once I was in the program, I realized that I wanted to pursue
					a career in web development. With that in mind, I started Caswel
					Marketing as a boutique marketing agency for political campaigns in
					Oregon. Caswel has allowed me to develop CMS websites for clients
					while also practice my marketing / graphic design skills. In April
					2020, I embarked on Codecademyâ€™s Web Development Career Path to take
					the next step towards my dream of becoming a developer! I finished
					their program in{" "}

				<h4>Me outside of code</h4>
				<h6>
					I allow myself to invest time is any and all interests. I've always
					believed in allowing yourself to grow in seemingly random avenues. I
					have deep dived into the world of specialty coffee. From
					differentiating between brewing methods to cupping coffee, I love
					experiencing cofffee. Music has been prevelant since I picked up my
					saxophone in middle school. With a minor is Jazz Performance, I can
					comfortably say that I am ready to jam out. Lastly, if you were to ask
					me what my biggest accomplishment is, I would answer with completing
					my first marathon last year.{" "}
